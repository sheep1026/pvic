## Abstract
> Recently, the DETR framework has emerged as the dominant approach for humanâ€“object interaction (HOI) research. In particular, two-stage transformer-based HOI detectors are amongst the most performant and training-efficient approaches. However, these often condition HOI classification on object features that lack fine-grained contextual information, eschewing pose and orientation information in favour of visual cues about object identity and box extremities. This naturally hinders the recognition of complex or ambiguous interactions. In this work, we study these issues through visualisations and carefully designed experiments. Accordingly, we investigate how best to re-introduce image features via cross-attention. With an improved query design, extensive exploration of keys and values, and box pair positional embeddings as spatial guidance, our model with enhanced predicate visual context (PViC) outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks, while maintaining low training cost.

## Prerequisites

1. Use the package management tool of your choice and run the following commands after creating your environment. 
    ```bash
    # Say you are using Conda
    conda create --name pvic python=3.8
    conda activate pvic
    # Required dependencies
    pip install torch==1.8.0+cu111 torchvision==0.9.0+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
    pip install matplotlib==3.6.3 scipy==1.10.0 tqdm==4.64.1
    pip install numpy==1.24.1 timm==0.6.12
    pip install wandb==0.13.9 seaborn==0.13.0
    # Clone the repo and submodules
    git clone https://github.com/fredzzhang/pvic.git
    cd pvic
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    pip install -e pocket
    # Build CUDA operator for MultiScaleDeformableAttention
    cd h_detr/models/ops
    python setup.py build install
    ```


## Inference

Visualisation utilities are implemented to run inference on a single image and visualise the cross-attention weights. A [reference model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ow476JpjrRNGMRd1f2DN_YJTOqtaOly/view?usp=sharing) is provided for demonstration purpose if you don't want to train a model yourself. Download the model and save it to `./checkpoints/`. Use the argument `--index` to select images and `--action` to specify the action index. Refer to the [lookup table](https://github.com/fredzzhang/upt/blob/main/assets/actions.txt) for action indices.

```bash
DETR=base python inference.py --resume checkpoints/pvic-detr-r50-hicodet.pth --index 4050 --action 111
```

The detected human-object pairs with scores overlayed are saved to `fig.png`, while the attention weights are saved to `pair_xx_attn_head_x.png`. Below are some sample outputs.

In addition, the argument `--image-path` enables inference on custom images.
